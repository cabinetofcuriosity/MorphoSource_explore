# MorphoSource_explore

# About

The purpose of this project is to explore and document methods on how to manipulate and extract 3D data. The primary data source we will be using comes from MorphoSource which provides free and accessible datasets [here](https://www.morphosource.org).

This repository will store all the notebooks, datasets, images, and other resources used in the exploration. The goal is to discover and provide repoducible methods for 3D data manipulation and image-processing.
